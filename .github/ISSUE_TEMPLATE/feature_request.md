## Feature description

<!-- What are you proposing? -->

## Why should this feature be part of the Pearl's core?

<!-- Orbiton JS aims to be a lean rendering engine, additional features should be implemented in form of 3rd party modifiers, why should this feature get to the core? -->

<!-- Incase you are requesting a feature for another package in this repository then indicate the package name -->
